## 1) AI Website Assistant for Customer Support
**Client Need:** Customers ask repeated questions and the team spends time answering basic inquiries.  
**Approach:**  
- Limited the assistant to trusted knowledge only (website + curated knowledge base)  
- Added strict “no hallucination” guardrails (if not in context → recommend contacting the team)  
- Built a clean chat UX with auto-scroll, voice input (speech-to-text), and lead capture  
**Outcome:**  
- Faster responses for common questions  
- Better user experience  
- Less workload on the support team

- Categorized leads into: **AI / Web / Digital Transformation**  
- Sent structured leads to email automatically (no database required)  
**Outcome:**  
- More qualified inquiries  
- Clearer visibility for the team
