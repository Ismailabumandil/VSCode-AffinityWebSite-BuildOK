# Objections & Responses (EN) — Affinity Technology

## 1) “Is AI expensive?”
AI can be implemented in phases. We usually start with a small, high-impact scope and scale gradually based on real results and usage.

## 2) “Will this require a lot of maintenance?”
We design solutions to be stable and easy to operate. Maintenance depends on complexity and traffic, and we can provide optional support plans.

## 3) “Can we control what the chatbot says?”
Yes. We can restrict the assistant to approved sources only (your website + curated knowledge base) and apply strict guardrails to avoid speculation or unverified answers.

## 4) “Does it support Arabic?”
Yes. Arabic and English are supported, and we can expand to additional languages when needed.

## 5) “Can it integrate with our systems?”
Yes. We can integrate via APIs (CRM, ticketing, ERP, analytics, forms, etc.) depending on your stack and access.

## 6) “What about privacy?”
We can design the assistant to avoid storing conversations (or store only what you explicitly allow). We also support secure secret management and best practices for compliance.

## 7) “Can it escalate to a human?”
Yes. We can add a human handoff workflow (email notifications, CRM ticket creation, live chat escalation, or scheduled callback).

## 8) “Will it guarantee ROI?”
We don’t guarantee ROI. Instead, we define measurable goals (response time, conversion, ticket reduction) and track performance iteratively.
