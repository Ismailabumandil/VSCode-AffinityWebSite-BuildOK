# Pricing Guidance (EN) — No fixed numbers

## How pricing is determined
Pricing depends on:
- Scope (features, pages, workflows)
- Complexity (integrations, data sources, multi-language)
- Timeline (delivery speed)
- Security requirements (access control, compliance needs)
- Support level (optional ongoing support)

## Do you offer fixed pricing?
We do not quote a fixed price without requirements. Each project is tailored.

## Typical delivery approach
1) Discovery call (15–30 min)
2) Requirements & scope definition
3) Proposal with timeline and deliverables
4) Implementation + iterative demos
5) Launch + optional support

## Quick qualification questions (for accurate estimation)
- What is the main goal (support, sales, automation)?
- Which channels (website only now, WhatsApp/CRM later)?
- Arabic only or bilingual?
- Any existing FAQ/docs?
- Expected traffic / number of inquiries?
- Required integrations (forms, CRM, email, ticketing)?
